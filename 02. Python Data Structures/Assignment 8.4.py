# Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the
#line into a list of words using the split() method. The program should build a
#list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already
#in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes,
#sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
