# Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method.
# The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list.
# When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
