#8.5 Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a
#line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
#From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
#You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in
#the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message).
#Then print out a count at the end.

#Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
