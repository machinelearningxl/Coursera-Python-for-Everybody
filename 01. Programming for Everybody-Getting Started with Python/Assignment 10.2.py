#10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the
#distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the
#hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the
#string a second time using a colon.

#Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts,
#sorted by hour as shown below. Note that the autograder does not have support
#for the sorted() function.

#You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt
