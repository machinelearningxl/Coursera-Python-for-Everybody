#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has
#the most commits. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word
#of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python
#dictionary that maps the senders mail address to a count of the number of
#times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program
#reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific
#committer.

#You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt
