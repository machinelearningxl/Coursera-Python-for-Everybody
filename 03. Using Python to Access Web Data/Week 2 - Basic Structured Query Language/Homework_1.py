# Counting Organizations

# This application will read the mailbox data (mbox.txt) count up the number
# email messages per organization (i.e. domain name of the email address) using
# a database with the following schema to maintain the counts.
'''
# CREATE TABLE Counts (org TEXT, count INTEGER)
'''
# You can use this code as a starting point for your application:
# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/emaildb.py.

# The data file for this application is the same as in previous assignments:
# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox.txt.

# Because the sample code is using an UPDATE statement and committing the
# results to the database as each record is read in the loop, it might take as
# long as a few minutes to process all the data. The commit insists on
# completely writing all the data to disk every time it is called.

# The program can be speeded up greatly by moving the commit operation outside
# of the loop. In any database program, there is a balance between the number of
# operations you execute between commits and the importance of not losing the
# results of operations that have not yet been committed.
